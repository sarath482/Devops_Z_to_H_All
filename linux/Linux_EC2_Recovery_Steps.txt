                Linux EC2 Access Recovery Techniques

 Common EC2 Access Issues & Recovery Methods
 
 1. What to do if PEM key is lost or corrupted?
 -----------------------------------------------
If your PEM key is corrupted or lost, you can't SSH directly into the EC2 instance.
 However, recovery is possible via:
 A. Detach Root Disk Method (Manual Recovery):
   - Stop the affected instance.
   - Detach its root volume (e.g., /dev/xvda).
   - Attach the root volume to another EC2 instance as a secondary volume.
   - SSH into the second instance and mount the volume.
   - Modify or add a new public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
   - Unmount and reattach the volume to the original instance.
   - Start the original instance and SSH using the new key.

 B. SSM (AWS Systems Manager) Method:
   - Use Session Manager to access EC2 without PEM or SSH.
   - Ensure SSM Agent is installed and running on the instance.
   - Attach IAM role with AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy.
   - Ensure network access to SSM endpoints.
   - Connect from AWS Console -> EC2 -> Connect -> Session Manager.


 2. What is SSM?
----------------
SSM = AWS Systems Manager. 
It provides secure remote access and management to EC2.
- No PEM or SSH required.
- Securely connect via AWS Console.
- Audit logs available.
- Works over HTTPS (no open port 22).
 Use Cases:- 
 Lost SSH key.
 - Automate patching.
 - Centralized command execution.

 3. Can we reset the EC2 root password?
 --------------------------------------
No direct password reset like traditional OS. 
Best way is to either:- Mount disk to another instance and change `authorized_keys`.
- Use SSM and reset user credentials inside the OS.
 4. What is the Azure equivalent of this process?
 ------------------------------------------------
In Azure:- Stop the VM.
- Detach the OS disk.
- Attach it to another VM.
- Mount and update credentials or SSH keys.
- Reattach and start original VM.
This is known as the "Rescue VM" method in Azure.
